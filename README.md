# pokedex_app

## Zipdev Flutter Code Assessment

This code assessment is to assess your expertise with Flutter as well as your general coding skills and is meant to be simple. Focus on writing clean, scalable and testable code using best practices for the Flutter framework.
Instructions
● Use the public Pokedex API [​https://pokeapi.co/](​https://pokeapi.co/)​ to create a small mobile application using Flutter
● In your mobile application create the following views:
  - Onboard/welcome
  - Login
  - Home (displaying pokemon)
  - Details Screen (once a pokemon is selected)
● Include
  - Documentation on how to run the project locally
  - Why do you chose the plugins used
Notes
● The onboarding/welcome should only be shown once and after logging into your account you should go straight to the home screen (do this locally, no back end is required).
● Although testing is not required at this point, your code should be structured in such a way that tests could be set up afterward.
● Polished UI design is not important for this task, basic is fine Please address any questions to your recruiter or to jobs@zipdev.com. Thank you,
The Zipdev Team
