# pokedex_app

## Instructions

● Use the public Pokedex API [​https://pokeapi.co/](​https://pokeapi.co/)​ to create a small mobile application using Flutter

● In your mobile application create the following views:
  - Onboard/welcome
  - Login
  - Home (displaying pokemon)
  - Details Screen (once a pokemon is selected)

● Include
  - Documentation on how to run the project locally
  - Why do you chose the plugins used

Notes

● The onboarding/welcome should only be shown once and after logging into your account you should go straight to the home screen (do this locally, no back end is required).

● Although testing is not required at this point, your code should be structured in such a way that tests could be set up afterward.
